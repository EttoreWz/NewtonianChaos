This project will act as a comprehenive review of using Newtonian Chaos as a viable probability distribution for a 6 sided-die. I will also be reviewing methods of extremity handling, namely bit rotations and division--to handle division by 0 in Newton's approximation and bit overflow. The project will use a Java Monte-Carlos simulator that will feed data to an SQL database, and cloud database, where selected data will be transferred to R for rigorous statistical analysis (including Chi-Squared Testing). Finally, results will be visualized using Tableau.
